  "description": "In this project, the problem of validating whether a string is a valid email address was addressed. To do this, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) was used. Finite automata are powerful tools for validating input strings against specific patterns, and in this case, it was used to evaluate whether a given string satisfies the rules of a valid email address.",
